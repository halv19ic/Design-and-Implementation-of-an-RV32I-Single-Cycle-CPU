# Design-and-Implementation-of-an-RV32I-Single-Cycle-CPU
This project provides a SystemVerilog implementation of a single-cycle RV32I CPU architecture. The design includes the ALU, control unit, register file, and memory interfaces. The CPU is verified and simulated using QuestaSim, making it a useful educational resource for learning RISC-V and RTL design.
